Task: Design and Implement a Web Application using Angular and Firebase

Description:
Your task is to design and implement a web application using Angular as the frontend framework and Firebase as the backend service. The application should provide a platform for users to engage in discussions on various topics. Users should be able to register, log in, create posts, comment on posts, and interact with other users.

Requirements:

Application Structure:

Implement a public part that includes the start page, user login, and user registration forms.
Create a private part for registered users that includes functionality such as user profile management, creating posts, commenting on posts, etc.
Dynamic Pages:

Design and implement at least three different dynamic pages that provide distinct functionality within the application. Examples could include a homepage displaying recent posts, a user profile page, a page to create new posts, a page to view and comment on posts, etc.
Angular Framework:

Use Angular for the client-side development of the application.
Utilize Angular's features and components to create a responsive and interactive user interface.
Communication with Firebase:

Implement communication between the Angular frontend and Firebase backend using Firebase SDK.
Use Firebase Firestore or Firebase Realtime Database to store and retrieve data such as user information, posts, and comments.
Utilize Firebase Authentication for user registration, login, and session management.
Authentication:

Implement user authentication using Firebase Authentication.
Allow users to register an account, log in, and log out securely.
Source Control:

Use a source control system like GitHub or Bitbucket to manage your codebase.
Commit your code regularly and maintain a repository with at least three days' worth of commits.
Error Handling and Data Validation:

Implement error handling mechanisms to handle and display errors gracefully.
Perform data validation to prevent crashes and ensure the integrity of the data entered by users.
Documentation:

Provide a brief documentation file (e.g., README.md) that explains the project and its architecture.
Include instructions on how to set up and run the application locally.
Usability, UI/UX, and Styling:

Design the user interface to be visually appealing, intuitive, and user-friendly.
Utilize UI frameworks like NGBootstrap, Material Design, CSS Grids, or any other suitable method to enhance the UI and UX of the application.
Bonus Features (Optional):

Deploy the application in a cloud environment (e.g., Firebase Hosting, Netlify, Heroku, etc.).
Integrate a file storage cloud API, such as Dropbox or Google Drive, for storing files associated with posts or user profiles.
Utilize HTML5 features like Geolocation, SVG, Canvas, etc., to enhance specific functionalities.
Incorporate Angular Animations to add engaging and interactive elements.
Write unit tests for your Angular components to ensure their correctness and stability.
Implement state management using RxJS and ngRx store, inspired by Redux, for a scalable and maintainable architecture.
Include any additional features that are not described in the assignment but have practical use within the application.
Project Defense:

Prepare a 20-minute presentation to demonstrate how the application works, including its features, functionality, and the source code.
Be ready to explain the project's architecture and how different components interact with each other.
Show and explain your codebase, highlighting important design decisions and implementation details.
There will be time for questions and feedback from trainers, so be prepared to address inquiries and discuss your work.
